For transferring linked data from Libris to local systems, our EMM API can be used. It implements the [Entity Metadata Management API 1.0 specification](https://emm-spec.org/1.0/), which is based on [Activity Streams 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/).

See https://github.com/libris/librisxl/blob/develop/emm/exampleclient/client.py for an example client with more information.
